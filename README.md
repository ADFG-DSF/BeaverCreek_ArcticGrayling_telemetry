# Beaver and Nome Creeks Arctic grayling radiotelemetry, 2021â€“2022

This project plan outlines a 2-year radiotelemetry study for Arctic grayling Thymallus arcticus in the Beaver Creek drainage. Information on life history, migration timing, and habitat use is needed to better understand the distribution of Arctic grayling during critical time periods and to inform a future population assessment. Radio transmitters with a 2-year operational life will be surgically implanted into 150 Arctic grayling in parts of the drainage that are most susceptible to sport fishing pressure. Aerial tracking flights to locate radiotagged Arctic grayling will be conducted during winter, spring, summer, and fall in order to identify, document, and characterize overwintering, spring spawning, and summer feeding areas. Location data will also be used to examine seasonal fidelity to these areas. Seasonal migration timing between Beaver Creek and its Nome Creek tributary will be determined with a stationary tracking station located near the confluence. Results from the radiotelemetry study will be used to select an appropriate index area and time for a mark-recapture experiment that will be conducted during summer 2023.
